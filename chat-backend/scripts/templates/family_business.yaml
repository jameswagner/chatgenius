organization:
  description: "A successful but chaotic family-owned bakery where personal and professional boundaries are constantly blurred. While beloved in the community for their authentic Italian pastries, the business struggles with modernization and family dynamics spilling into daily operations."
  culture: "Intensely familial and emotional. Work and personal life are completely intertwined, with family drama regularly affecting business decisions."
  communication_style: "Highly informal and personal. Business discussions frequently devolve into family history, personal matters, and old grievances. Public channels often contain thinly-veiled references to private family issues."
  challenges:
    - Constant tension between tradition (Nonna) and modernization (Tony/Lucia)
    - Family conflicts affecting business operations and employee morale
    - Difficulty maintaining professional boundaries with non-family employees
    - Resistance to documented processes (everything is "in the family's heads")
    - Personal rivalries influencing business decisions
    - Succession planning causing intergenerational tension
