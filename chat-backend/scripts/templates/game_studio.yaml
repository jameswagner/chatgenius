organization:
  description: "A passionate but chaotic indie game studio struggling with its first major release. Founded by college friends, the studio has grown beyond their management capabilities while trying to maintain its 'cool startup' culture."
  culture: "Creative and informal but increasingly strained. Oscillates between intense crunch and periods of unfocused experimentation. Strong resistance to traditional project management."
  communication_style: "Casual and meme-heavy, mixing technical discussions with gaming references. Late-night messages common during crunch periods."
  challenges:
    - "Feature creep due to lack of clear product vision"
    - "Mounting technical debt from rapid prototyping"
    - "Inexperienced leadership avoiding difficult decisions"
    - "Burnout from unsustainable work practices"
    - "Discord between art team's vision and technical limitations"
    - "Funding pressure creating timeline stress"
