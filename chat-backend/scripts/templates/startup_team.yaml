organization:
  name: "QuickShip Logistics"
  description: "A rapidly growing logistics tech startup that has sacrificed team health for growth. Despite recent funding success and customer growth, the company suffers from technical debt, unclear direction, and mounting team burnout."
  culture: "Fast-paced and chaotic with a 'move fast and break things' mentality that's starting to backfire. Success metrics prioritized over team wellbeing."
  communication_style: "Urgent and often contradictory. Many decisions happen in private messages, leading to confusion. Public praise but private criticism."
  challenges:
    - Unsustainable work pace leading to widespread burnout
    - Technical debt accumulating due to constant pivots
    - Knowledge silos due to poor documentation and high turnover
    - Unclear decision-making processes and frequent reversals
    - Growing tension between engineering quality and business deadlines
    - Implicit pressure to work weekends and be "always on"
